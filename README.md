## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.
*   A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).
*   Wrangler CLI installed and configured: `bun install -g wrangler`.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd pazebem_academy
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

### Running Locally

To start the development server, which includes the Vite frontend and the Wrangler server for the backend worker, run:

```sh
bun dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

The project is structured into three main parts:

*   `src/`: Contains the React frontend application, including pages, components, hooks, and utility functions.
*   `worker/`: Contains the Hono backend application running on a Cloudflare Worker. All API logic and Durable Object interactions are handled here.
*   `shared/`: Contains TypeScript types and interfaces shared between the frontend and the backend to ensure type safety.

### Adding API Endpoints

To add new API routes, modify the `worker/user-routes.ts` file. The application uses an entity-based abstraction over the Durable Object for cleaner data management.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is designed for easy deployment to Cloudflare's global network.

1.  **Build the project:**
    ```sh
    bun run build
    ```

2.  **Deploy to Cloudflare:**
    ```sh
    bun run deploy
    ```

This command will build the application and deploy the worker and static assets to your Cloudflare account.

Alternatively, deploy directly from your GitHub repository with a single click:
